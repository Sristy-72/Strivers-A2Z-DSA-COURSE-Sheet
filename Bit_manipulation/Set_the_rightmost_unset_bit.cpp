//Given a non-negative number n . The problem is to set the rightmost unset bit in the binary representation of n.

//Examples :

//Input: n = 6
//Output: 7
//Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is 110. After setting right most bit it becomes 111 which is 7.

class Solution {
  public:
    int setBit(int n) {
        // Write Your Code here
        int val= n | (n+1);
        return val;
    }
};
